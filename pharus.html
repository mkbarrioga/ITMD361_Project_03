              Sometimes a safe and caring space is all that a child needs in order to learn and grow.
            </h2>
            <p>
              &emsp; The truth is... not everyone gets adopted and not everyone gets to have a privilege for a loving home.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp; About 100,000 of the 400,000 children currently in the system are waiting to be adopted, either by their foster parents 
              or by adoptive families who have not fostered before. According to the Immigration and Nationality Act, the definition 
              of an orphan is a child who has experienced <q>the death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation
              or loss from, both parents.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp; Pharus Spei means beacon of hope. It is a home for 1000 Staff and Volunteers who have dedicated themselves in creating a
              loving, understanding, and uplifting atmosphere for the children who are members of the family. It is a mansion with complete
              amenities that cater each child&#x27;s unique talents and gifts. From Nursery to Senior High, Pharus Spei has all the necessary
              resources to become the best version of his/herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              &emsp; The institution boasts of camaraderie and spirit of oneness. Its mission is to be the family that every orphan needs and each 
              member are siblings. Pharus Spei members conduct community services, fund-raisers, and talent shows as part of routine 
              activities. Both children and young adults are connected with guidance counselors/therapists all throughout their tenure.

          <h2>Education is the key</h2>
          <p>
            &emsp; When we open the door to an education, we unlock the future for children. Education is the difference between failure and success. 
            It is the difference between poverty and plenty. Without an education, jobs are hard to come by, and without a job, 
            a mother or father cannot feed their children. When parents cannot support their families, the family unit often breaks up, 
            and children end up on the streets. 
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp; Pharus Spei is both a home and a school. We believe that education is they to end poverty. By fostering individuals and 
            shaping them to be part of a productive future, it becomes already the school&#x27;s greatest achievement. Children who stay in our 
            center have the opportunity to not only attend school but to thrive and reach their full potential. Our students not only take
            regular classes but they also receive training in life skills like cooking, money management, and relationship building.

            The organization was founded on the promise of taking children from unpleasant situations and helping them thrive so that 
            they can live full of hope and realize their God-given potential.

            <p>
              &emsp; The school provides activities for the community members to engage on so that members are able to utilize the resources at a weekly basis and ensures each
              student takes an active role in the activities. We conduct yearly inter-class PE competition on different sports and as well as concerts and theatrical 
              shows performed by the school&#x27;s Music and Performing Arts Club and mostly in line with school&#x27;s fundraising events.
